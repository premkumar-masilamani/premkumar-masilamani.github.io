# Premkumar Masilamani – Personal Website

This [website](http://www.premkumarmasilamani.com) is built with **Jekyll**, runs on **GitHub Pages**, and intentionally uses **HTML only** - no CSS or JavaScript.

Everything in this repository is **open source**. Feel free to **fork, modify, and repurpose** the content as you wish.

I’d appreciate a link back, though it’s not mandatory. Attribution is goodwill, not obligation.

Let’s normalize open-source collaboration across every industry.

Thanks for being here,
