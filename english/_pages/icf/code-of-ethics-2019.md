As an ICF credentialled Coach, this is my attempt to understand the **Ethical Standards** outlined by ICF, word by word, without any ambiguity. I've used ChatGPT to produce most of this text. So, feel free to copy, edit and distribute as you like it.

## Ethical Standards

The following ethical standards are applied to the professional activities of ICF Professionals:

### Section I – Responsibility to Clients

---

As an ICF Professional, I:

```
1. Explain and ensure that, prior to or at the initial meeting, my coaching Client(s) and Sponsor(s) understand the nature and potential value of coaching, the nature and limits of confidentiality, financial arrangements, and any other terms of the coaching agreement.
```

#### Explain and ensure that
- **Explain**
  - The coach is responsible for **clearly articulating** key information, not assuming clients or sponsors already know.
  - This includes **verbal explanation**, written documentation (contracts, welcome kits), and time for questions.

    ✅ **Example:** A coach describes the coaching process using a visual journey map during the discovery call.

- **Ensure**
  - Go beyond explaining - **confirm comprehension**.
  - Ask for feedback, invite questions, and encourage paraphrasing (Tell me what you understood about confidentiality.).

    ✅ **Scenario:**
    A coach explains confidentiality and then says,
    _To make sure we're aligned, could you summarize what you understand about what stays private versus what might be shared with your sponsor?_

#### Prior to or at the initial meeting

- This sets a **timeline boundary**.
- Ethical responsibility begins **before any coaching work starts**.

  ✅ **Example:**
  Before a kickoff session, the coach sends a PDF outlining terms and follows up with a 15-minute onboarding call to walk through the document.

  ⚠️ **Risk Scenario:**
  A coach skips this step and starts coaching immediately. Later, the client is surprised to learn that session notes were shared with HR. This breach could have been avoided by early clarification.

#### My coaching Client(s) and Sponsor(s)

- **Client(s):** The person being coached (individual or group).
- **Sponsor(s):** The person(s) or organization paying for or authorizing the coaching. Often HR, a manager, or leadership in corporate settings.

  ✅ **Scenario:**
  A leadership coach works with a senior manager (client) but is contracted by the organization (sponsor). Both need clarity on what will be shared (e.g., progress vs. content).

#### Understand the nature and potential value of coaching

- **Nature:** What coaching is and isn't.
  - It's a partnership.
  - It's forward-focused and client-led.
  - It's not therapy, consulting, or mentoring.

- **Potential Value:** Outcomes clients can expect, but not guaranteed.
  - Improved self-awareness.
  - Better decision-making.
  - Goal clarity and achievement.

  ✅ **Example Explanation:**
  _Coaching helps you uncover your own answers. I won't advise or fix problems, but I will help you build clarity and take action._

  ⚠️ **Misunderstanding Risk:**
  A client thinks coaching includes career advice or therapy. Coach fails to clarify. This leads to scope creep or unmet expectations.

#### The nature and limits of confidentiality

- **Nature:**
  - Sessions are private.
  - Coaches won't share content without permission.

- **Limits:**
  - Sponsors may receive progress updates.
  - Legal obligations override confidentiality (e.g., if there's a risk of harm or illegal activity).

  ✅ **Scenario:**
  The coach says,
  _Everything we discuss stays between us, unless you give explicit permission. The only exception is if you reveal something that suggests harm to self or others._

  ✅ **Sponsor Scenario:**
  _The sponsor will receive a general progress report, like milestones achieved - not session content, unless you approve it._

#### Financial arrangements

- This includes:
  - Fees and payment schedules
  - Refund/cancellation policies
- Invoicing and taxes (if applicable)

  ✅ **Scenario:**
  A coach outlines in writing:
  - 6 sessions at $250 each
  - 24-hour cancellation policy
  - Payment via Stripe within 7 days of invoice

  ⚠️ **Risk Scenario:**
  Client is unaware of cancellation fees. They cancel late and refuse to pay. The coach has no ethical leverage without prior documentation.

#### Any other terms of the coaching agreement

- **Catch-all phrase** ensuring everything relevant is covered:
  - Session frequency and duration
  - Methods of communication (Zoom, in person)
  - Record-keeping practices
  - Data privacy (especially if sessions are recorded)
  - Boundaries of contact outside sessions

  ✅ **Example Add-on Terms:**
  - Sessions are 60 minutes.
  - I will not coach you via text.
  - All notes are confidential and stored securely.
  - Coaching ends if payment lapses for more than 30 days.

### Section 1, Clause 1 - Summary:

|Area|Explanation|
|---|---|
|**Clarity**|Use plain language; avoid jargon|
|**Confirmation**|Ask clients to rephrase or sign documents|
|**Documentation**|Always have a coaching agreement in writing|
|**Customization**|Adjust explanations based on sponsor vs. individual context|
|**Boundaries**|Define scope, role, and limits explicitly|

Please re-read the section 1, clause 1 to ensure that you understood every word!

As an ICF Professional, I:

```
2. Create an agreement / contract regarding the roles, responsibilities and rights of all parties involved with my Client(s) and Sponsor(s) prior to the commencement of services.
```
