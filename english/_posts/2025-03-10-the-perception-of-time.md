### What is time?

> Time = duration between two events

Let's say, a person walks one mile. The moment he starts walking is the first event and the moment he stops walking is the second event. The duration between these two events is what we call time.

However, this measurement of time will not be consistent. One person may walk faster, and another may walk slower. We need a reliable way to measure time. Here comes the atomic clock.

> 1 second = the duration of 9,192,631,770 cycles of microwave radiation to be emitted during the transition between two energy levels of a cesium-133 atom

If you don't understand the above statement, please think, there is a reliable way to measure a time at atomic levels.

Time is a theoretical concept, we humans devised to make sense of the sequence of events that happen to us. It messes up my mind, when physicists dilate, stretch, and stop time in their explanations and formulae, as if it's a real thing like gravity or electromagnetism.

### What is Time Dilation?

> Time dilation is the phenomenon where time slows down relative to an observer due to high velocity (special relativity) or strong gravitational fields (general relativity).

I hope you have seen Interstellar movie, the lead character Cooper travels close to a black hole, and when he comes back, his daughter Murphy is much older than him. They say time slows down near black holes. That's time dilation.

Let's take the same example.

- A man walks a mile in 15 mins.
- The same man roller skates a mile in 5 mins.
- The same man walks a mile underwater, in the ocean bed in 2 hours.

When I present this situation to you and ask your observation, what would you say?.

I'd say, the man moves faster in roller skates and moves slower underwater. I'd never ever in my wildest imagination, would say that the time moves faster for the man on roller skates and moves slower for the man underwater. You'd laugh. Yeah.

But the physicists did exactly that. No one laughed, because we have no idea what the hell they were talking about. I oversimplified the concept with this example, but that's the core idea.

> The real question is - Is time actually slowing down, or is the duration between events increasing?

What does it mean, the duration between the events is increasing?.

Let's try a different example (lifespan is simplified),
- A butterfly is born, reproduces, and dies in 1 week
- A human is born, reproduces, and dies in 80 years
- A tortoise is born, reproduces, and dies in 150 years

If I ask, what do you observe about the lifespan of these species?. I'd say, yeah different species and different lifespans, what's there to say anything?. Fair enough.

As a thought experiment, imagine the butterfly and tortoise have human form and live a human life, but in their own lifespan. You will not know what their origin species is. Nothing is not human about them. If you ask each of them separately on their deathbed, they would say they have lived a happy long life.

What would be your observation now?. One lives normal, one lives fast and one lives slow. It's difficult to explain.

As a follow-up thought experiment, put the tortoise-human on a planet near a black hole and the butterfly-human on a small planet far away from any other large objects, regular humans on the earth. Now observe. What do you have to say?

Oh, they are all humans. From their perspective, they live a long life. Nothing is different for them. But when I observe from Earth, the human near the black hole lives longer and the human on a faraway planet lives shorter. What could be the reason?

They must perceive time differently. Time slows down for the man near the black hole and moves faster for a man on a faraway planet. Really?. How?

This is what physicists concluded, purely because - without this notion, none of their formulae work. The speed of light is fixed and they cannot explain the behavior of a fast-moving object or an object near huge gravitational pull without stretching or shrinking the time.

### Perception in Physics

All of the convincing explanations for time dilation involves, the perception of time relative to the observer. (i.e.) The person near the black hole or in a rocket perceives the time the same as us, on earth. Is that true?. We don't know. No one ever went to a black hole.

I even heard an absurd explanation that photons never perceive time because they travel at the speed of light?. The photon that was created during the Big Bang wouldn't perceive that billions of years have already passed. These are extrapolated explanations to make the concept interesting, but it has the adverse effect of confusing the concept further.

How did we accept that concept then?. We flew around the world in an airplane, and the atomic clock in the plane moved slower than the one stationed on the earth. So, we observed the result of this experiment, which aligns with Einstein's relativity theory and helps us make the GPS satellites work accurately. Again, this is the result of the experiment, not the real reason why the time appears to be dilated?

All the explanations I have heard are based on the human perception of time in different places in the universe.

Let's take an extreme example. A person born blind, dumb, deaf, and paralyzed completely, survives on medical support. Technically, there is no input from the outside world that goes to him. It's just dark and silent. But his brain is active.

There are no perceivable events in his life. So, there is no duration between the events. How would he perceive time?

Forever?.

Would he feel any difference in being near a black hole or a faraway planet?.

Explain to him in first principles, what exactly is happening, since he doesn't have a concept of time.

Now, we get to the real question.

### Time Dilation from First Principles

All physical interactions/movements must slow down including the vibrations of atoms, movements of free objects, orbiting of planets, the movement of light, near high gravitational pull, or at high speed.

Oh wait, we have to exclude light from this list - otherwise, all our formulae will fail. All our experiments already proved that the light speed is constant. Hmm... Okay.

I don't know anything more than this. If anyone has a clear explanation of the reason behind time dilation under gravity or high velocity, please let me know.

### Time Dilation as a Spectrum

If time can move slower or faster depending on the speed and gravity, how far can we stretch the concept of time dilation?

- If time can move slower, is there a place in the universe where the time stops?
- If time can move faster, is there a place in the universe where time is infinitely fast?
- How would an infinitely fast time and a still time look like?
- If we warp the space between infinitely fast time and a still time, what would happen?
- If any of the above is not possible due to physical constraints, what are the practical limits on how fast/slow time can go relative to time on earth? Can we define a boundary for time dilation?

### Conclusion

- Time is a theoretical concept, simply a way to measure the duration between events.
- It's much easier to explain the time dilation (side effects) to the public, than the real reason behind the side effect.
- Scientists could have created a new vocabulary to explain a new concept rather than twisting existing vocabulary to explain.
