title: Books I Love
---

I began to understand that reading books is a personal experience and the same book would have a different experience with different people.
I've decided not to write book reviews and possibly affect your experience by setting up an expectation with my experience. I've removed all of my existing book reviews. If a book brings a smile or an idea or the feeling of time well spent, you would find it in this list. This list is compiled from Jan 1, 2021 onwards.
