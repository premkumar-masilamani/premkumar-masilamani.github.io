I told everyone, that I was an accidental Coach, that it happened out of nowhere.

Below is a blog post I wrote 13 years ago. It seems that I wanted to become a Life Coach then.

Then life happened, dreams forgotten, successful career in Silicon Valley, running after new shiny goals and achieving them too. I had everything, but still, something was missing. It felt like I was repeating my yesterday in a loop. No matter what I do, I cannot be at peace. I was longing for something that I could not even describe. I quit my software job and came back to India to discover myself.

Around the same time, I met Arvind Ramasundaram, who nudged me to become a coach. I thought, "Why not? Let's do it". Trust me, I didn't like coaching when I started, I couldn't tolerate silence. Somehow, I persisted. I still don't know why.

Today, I am an ICF credentialed Level 1 Coach. At the end of every coaching session, I recognize "that missing piece" in my clients' smiles. I can describe my feelings now - "peace", as if I am meant for this.

I am surprised that even after forgetting my dream, I did achieve it. I didn't even realize that I was living in my dream from 13 years ago until I stumbled upon this old post. I am happy for what it is now and curious to explore what more life has to offer.

Do you want to recall your forgotten dreams?

Do you want to rediscover yourself?.

Let's do it, together!
