I wish I could hold time <br/>
And be here forever <br/>
As long as the stars live <br/>
But all I have is tonight

Take me in your arms <br/>
Hold me for the very last time <br/>
Like you could never let go <br/>
For all I have is tonight

Let's try and fool the time <br/>
And live this night forever <br/>
Like there is no tomorrow <br/>
Beyond the confines of tonight

Don't look at the clock <br/>
For the time's ticking away <br/>
To tear me away from you <br/>
For all we have is tonight

Take my life in return <br/>
But give me your love <br/>
To stay buried in my heart <br/>
Even after long tonight

And I shall never be alone <br/>
Till death do us apart <br/>
If only you give me your love <br/>
And never take back this night

When the morning creeps up <br/>
And wrenches you from me <br/>
I'll go back to sleep <br/>
And pretend it's still tonight

Down the lanes of future <br/>
I'll smile through my tears <br/>
When I look back at you <br/>
And embrace the memories of tonight

&#x2010; A poem from a friend!
