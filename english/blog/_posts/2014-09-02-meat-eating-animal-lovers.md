title: Meat-Eating Animal Lovers

First, let me be clear.

I am not here to judge you based on your eating habits.

I am here, writing this post, looking for possible answers to a few questions that popped into my mind recently.

I know a few people who care for their pets so much that they feed their pets with the best food available in the market, play with them all the time, make them sleep in a comfy bed, switch on the fan/AC, close the door slowly - and then come to the kitchen to slice the meat to prepare delicious food for the family, without the consciousness of the cruelty that the dead animal went through to become a slice of meat in the plate.

I should not say that they are not aware of the cruelty. My wife always asks me to buy fresh meat. I had asked her many times to accompany me to the butcher shop, where you can choose the chicken; the butcher would kill the bird in front of us, remove the skin, and chop them into small pieces - so perfect for our biriyani.

She always refused to come. She said, "I can't withstand the sound of the bird flapping their wings hard against the walls while dying".

But, She loves to eat chicken and prepares extraordinary South Indian biryani. She is one of the best cooks. I don't blame her. My wife is not alone. Millions of such people selectively ignore a few things to keep their mind at peace.

I have a question for pet lovers who eat meat.

> How do you decide which animals are worthy of love and respect and which ones deserve abuse and slaughter?

Think about it once, please.

OK. Leaving aside the pet/animal lovers, what about other people?

I cannot simply put everyone in one bucket. Can I?

Some people can kill the animals, chop them, cook them, and eat them - without much of the talking going on in their heads. They know what they are doing and feel nothing about it. Happy about the meal they just got. Shall we call them **The Predators**?

Some people cannot withstand the slaughtering process but enjoy the processed meat. In a sense, they cannot kill an animal but can eat what was killed by another predator. Shall we call them **The Scavengers**?

Who are you?

The Predator or The Scavenger?

## Some of the discussions with my friends.

**Some animals are here for us to eat and some are here for our companionship.**

No animal or species has evolved over millions of years, just to provide companionship for humans. We domesticated them, trained them, and fed them for thousands of years - which makes modern humans believe that both species evolved specifically to co-exist.

**I only eat humanely raised and slaughtered animals.**

Well. That's a contradiction depending on your definition of "humanity". What difference does the "humanely-raised" experience make at the moment of slaughtering? You still kill and eat them anyway.

**So, what's the conclusion?**

Should there be one for every article?
