**2009** - I was using _FrontServlet in Java 2.0_ while building the backend API for the Amex iPhone app. I had to do everything in the code, including the routing logic, business logic, dispatching to JSP, etc.

Felt like assembling a car in the manufacturing line.

**2011** - I was using _Spring Framework_. It handled everything, including routing, dependency injection, annotations, and more. And with Spring Boot and Docker, it was real magic. I could just focus on the business logic.

Felt like driving the car on the roads.

**2025** - I am using _Vibe Coding_. I could tell a LLM what I want and it gives me the code which works most of the time. All I have to do is run the code. I could focus on optimization AFTER it works. It's more than magic.

Felt like having a personal chauffeur driving me around.

In the past few weeks, I could do

- Trading systems that backtest 5 different MAs and crossovers over 1000 time periods and give me the best-performing MAs and setups for a given asset.
- Systems to transcribe my coaching sessions, and provide a summary and key points to publish as blog posts, all locally on my laptop.
- Many other utilities around photography, bitcoin mining, trading, IFTTT, etc.

I had no idea of the frameworks or libraries to use, and it took hardly a few hours each. It's like getting the job done and figuring out how it's done and learning from it.

I don't think, I'll go back to the old ways of programming. The least I can accept is - I will not use LLMs on the internet and be OK with running them locally.

I actually want to attend a technical interview and say, "I only do vibe coding !".

Is anyone interested in hiring me? 😜
