Out of all I wrote, if I could make one person think and question their reality, I feel complete as a writer. I encourage all my readers to challenge my thoughts and engage in a fearless conversation. Beneath all the roughness, there lies a soft beating heart, yearning for love, delighting in the feminine, expressing emotions in <a href="https://tamil.smileprem.com">poetry</a> and lives in ephemeral bubbles of happiness.</p>
